PHP Submission and SQL Integration
----------------------------------

In this project, I implemented AJAX-based form submissions for a dynamic form using PHP as the backend handler. My initial goal was to save the form data to a SQL database. However, due to time constraints, I was unable to fully integrate the SQL database functionality.

The PHP script is designed to accept form data via POST requests and handle basic validation. If I had more time, I would have established a connection to a MySQL database using **PDO** and saved the submitted form data into a properly structured SQL table.

Key next steps for completing the SQL integration would include:

*   Creating the necessary SQL tables to store the form data.
    
*   Writing PHP logic to insert form submissions into the database.
    
*   Implementing error handling and confirmation for successful database writes.
    

Although the SQL integration wasn't completed, the groundwork for handling form data with PHP is in place, and the next step would be linking it with the database for data persistence.
